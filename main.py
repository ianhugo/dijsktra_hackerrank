'''
#given n is the dimension of a nxn squared chess board
#given knight starting position
#given bishop stationary position
#given destination coordinate
#compute, shortest route from starting to destination for the knight using legal moves
#make sure to evade the tiles that the bishop could threaten from its stationery position

General Approach:
model as graph, with vertices as valid tiles for the knight, edges meaning a valid route
take out coordinates that are threatened by bishop
run Dijsktra√ü
